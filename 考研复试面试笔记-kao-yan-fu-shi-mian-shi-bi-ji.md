## 毕设

关键词：graduation project

&emsp;My graduation project is xxxxx. The whole system is divided into three layers, the upper layer is xxxx the middle is xxxx, and the bottom layer is xxxx. My task is to design xxxx and verify them on a platform. I am currently studying the existing papers.

## 我本专业怎么样

问题：What do you think of your major?

&emsp;My major covers many fields of knowledge, including electronics, materials, electromagnetic waves, optics, and more. Therefore, it is more difficult for most students.

## 网络安全专业怎么样？

问题：What do you think of the cyber security major?

&emsp;For the network security major, I have two views. First, I think it's fun, which is the first reason why I choose this major. Second, I think data is very important in the Internet age, and it becomes very important to protect or mine data. Therefore, the network security major is a very important major.

## 为什么选择网络安全专业

问题：Why choose our major/cyber security major?

&emsp;There are three reasons. First, I like this major. Second, I think data is very important in the Internet age, whether for individuals or collectives. Both protecting data and mining data have become so important. These two points are also my views on the cyber security major. Third, I studied a wide range of fields during my undergraduate studies. I think that if I want to do a good job in cyber security, I should have a wide range of study fields.

## 为什么喜欢网络安全？

问题：Why love/like cyber security

&emsp;I like cyber security first because of a movie called "Who Am I, No Safe System", I want to be a hacker, maybe it is naive, but it really planted a seed in my heart . Then the seed grew slowly later, so I chose to major in cyber security.

## 家乡

问题：how is your hometown

&emsp;In fact, there is nothing special about my hometown, but for me, what makes it special is my hometown. In my hometown, my pace of life is slow, which allows me to calm down and think about many issues. Every year when I go home for the new year, I always like to slow down my pace of life and enjoy a pleasant time.

# 万能回答法

I'm very sorry. Ashamed to say, I don't know how to answer this question. May I tell you why I chose the major of cyber security? Maybe my answer doesn't seem to pass the Turing test!

# 专业知识总结

- 反爬虫

  > 请求头部中的一些字段（如cookies，refer，user-agent等等）
  >
  > JavaScript的一些行为，动态渲染，异步请求，使得爬虫获取的资源不正确
  >
  > CSS渲染，将一些资源序列进行变更，这样也可能使得浏览器可视资源与爬虫获取资源不同

- 网络API

  > 网络API不同于爬虫，网络API是为了开发者更好地使用，因此往往有文档以及接口
  >
  > 我常查看文档来编写，比如之前的ChatGPT qq聊天机器人

- Linux系统

  > Linux软硬链接区别：软链接只会指向源文件，硬链接是一个实体文件，但是和源文件是同一个文件，类似于C++中的共享指针一样。`ln -s link src`(软)  `ln link src`(硬)
  >
  > 权限：文件的权限分为读写执行三个权限，一般的脚本文件都需要设置可执行权限
  >
  > 用户权限：`chmod`
  >
  > 更改文件所有者：`chown`
  >
  > 黑洞文件：`/dev/null`
  >
  > 通配符：`*` 和 `?`和`[a-z]` 表示任意的所有字符和任意的一个字符和方括号中的一个字符

# 英文自我介绍

&emsp;Hello, professors, my name isxxx. I majored in xxxxx. I am very happy to participate in this interview.

&emsp;During my undergraduate, I worked hard at school and achieved excellent results. My GPA is xxx, ranking xxx out of xxx in our major. The grade point of many courses such as advanced mathematics, C language, Java, data structure and algorithm is around xxx.

&emsp;I have actively participated in competitions and won many awards, such as the First Prize in the computer contest, the M Prize in the Mathematical Contest In Modeling and so on. I am skilled in C/C++ and Linux systems. I deploy my blog on a cloud serve. Additionally, I am good at Python and web API calls. I often used Matlab to verify our models in mathematical modeling.

&emsp;In addition to studying, I serve as a lecturer and vice-chairman of the computer department in Association for Science and Technology. I managed the lab, and represent the club at meetings led by teachers.

&emsp;In the first year of postgraduate, I will continue to study hard and expand my knowledge about cyber security, I will determine the research direction and follow the frontier trends. In the second year, I will start to prepare my graduation thesis, find an innovative point and conduct in-depth research. Finally, I will make excellent results and complete my graduation thesis. If possible, I would choose to study for a Ph.D.

&emsp;Thank you for listening!

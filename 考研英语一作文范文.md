## 题目描述

## 自己的范文（116words）

&emsp;Dear international student volunteer:

&emsp;I'm an undergraduate working for the "Aiding Rural Primary Schools" project. I'm writing this letter to answer your inquiry. 

&emsp;First of all, so poor rural are primary schools that students, studying there, fail to read some books they want, although those schools have made the effort to meet their needs. Additionally, it is pen and paper that have the greatest importance for them to express their thoughts. At last, if there were no teachers who are fluent in spoken English in rural primary schools, they wouldn't chat with international students in the future.

&emsp;These issues should be resolved by us. I look forward to your reply if it is convenient for you.

<p align="right">Yours,</p>

&emsp;What is evident is that in the photograph, a boy who is tired as well as upset is sitting on the right of the picture. On the contrary, another boy looking extraordinarily confident is encouraging him to continue climbing. The symbolic meaning of the cartoon is quite self-evident: It is persistence that keeps as indispensable as sunshine, which has the magic power to make success.

&emsp;It keeps my perspective that the issue has its deep roots as follows. First of all, not only does success require direction but needs motivation provided by persistence. Additionally, "Everything needs persistence," said Masami Horri from an organization in Japan devoted to social science research. Last but not least, if one, when facing difficulty, chose to give up, he or she would fail to do anything, whose goal would not have arrived forever, and he or she would only live a life of relative failure.

&emsp;There is no doubt that persistence plays a key role in one's success. Why not take all their persistence to do what they want?

On the contrary, his father looking extraordinarily well-knowledge is answering him that it is enough that he likes that.

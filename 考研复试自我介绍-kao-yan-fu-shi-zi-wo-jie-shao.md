&emsp;各位老师好，我叫梁敏智，今年21岁，来自于湖南。我本科就读于南京邮电大学电子科学与技术专业。非常高兴参加这次期待已久的面试，以下是我的个人情况。

&emsp;在我本科四年期间，我努力学习学校课程，成绩优异。平均绩点3.70，在本专业223人中排名31。其中高等数学，C语言，Java，数据结构与算法等多门课程的绩点在4.5左右。

&emsp;在竞赛方面，我积极参加各类竞赛并获得许多奖项，比如在计算机设计大赛获得国家一等奖，在挑战杯“黑科技”专项赛获得国家一等奖，在美赛数学建模大赛中获得Meritorious 等等。但最令我最深刻的是电子设计大赛的无人机项目，它虽然没有获奖，但在为期一年的准备中，我从中学到了许多计算机方面知识。我擅长使用C或者C++在MCU以及嵌入式Linux系统上进行项目的开发。我对使用Linux有丰富的经验，我在云服务器上部署了我的个人博客。此外，我还擅长使用Python脚本，网络爬虫和网络API接口调用。在我参加数学建模期间，我常用Matlab来验证我们的模型。我还了解过其他的一些编程语言，如前端三件套，Java，lisp函数式编程等等。我觉得我的学习领域是比较广泛的。

&emsp;除了学习之外，我经常参与社团活动。我在学院科学技术协会中担任计算机部门的讲师与副主席各一年。我负责的工作有，为新部员讲授计算机知识的工作，管理实验室秩序的工作，参与学院的迎新工作以及作为代表参与老师召开的社团会议。

&emsp;我对研究生期间的规划是：在研一期间，我会继续努力学习学校课程，在此基础上，拓展关于网络安全方面的知识。我会确定好研究方向并时刻关注研究领域的前沿动态，为将来的科研工作打下坚实的基础。在研二期间，我将开始准备我的毕业论文，我会努力找到一个具有创新性的研究点，并对此进行深入的学习。在研三时，我将尽我最大的努力做出有创新性的研究成果并完成好我的毕业论文。

&emsp;如果有机会的话，我希望读博进行深造。在此以后，我想要留高校任教，我希望我能够在科研领域有所成就。

&emsp;谢谢老师们的聆听！！！

## 毕设

关键词：graduation project

&emsp;My graduation project is visual multi-terminal system communication and encryption algorithm design. The whole system is divided into three layers, the upper layer is the main control system, the middle is the terminal system, and the bottom layer is the vehicle. My task is to design an encryption algorithm and a set of common data specifications, and verify them on a platform. I am currently studying the existing papers.

## 我本专业怎么样

问题：What do you think of your major?

&emsp;My major covers many fields of knowledge, including electronics, materials, electromagnetic waves, optics, and more. Therefore, it is more difficult for most students.

## 网络安全专业怎么样？

问题：What do you think of the cyber security major?

&emsp;For the network security major, I have two views. First, I think it's fun, which is the first reason why I choose this major. Second, I think data is very important in the Internet age, and it becomes very important to protect or mine data. Therefore, the network security major is a very important major.

## 为什么选择网络安全专业

问题：Why choose our major/cyber security major?

&emsp;There are three reasons. First, I like this major. Second, I think data is very important in the Internet age, whether for individuals or collectives. Both protecting data and mining data have become so important. These two points are also my views on the cyber security major. Third, I studied a wide range of fields during my undergraduate studies. I think that if I want to do a good job in cyber security, I should have a wide range of study fields.

## 为什么喜欢网络安全？

问题：Why love/like cyber security

&emsp;I like cyber security first because of a movie called "Who Am I, No Safe System", I want to be a hacker, maybe it is naive, but it really planted a seed in my heart . Then the seed grew slowly later, so I chose to major in cyber security.

## 家乡

问题：how is your hometown

&emsp;In fact, there is nothing special about my hometown, but for me, what makes it special is my hometown. In my hometown, my pace of life is slow, which allows me to calm down and think about many issues. Every year when I go home for the new year, I always like to slow down my pace of life and enjoy a pleasant time.

# 万能回答法

I'm very sorry. Ashamed to say, I don't know how to answer this question. May I tell you why I chose the major of cyber security? Maybe my answer doesn't seem to pass the Turing test!

# 专业知识总结

- 反爬虫

  > 请求头部中的一些字段（如cookies，refer，user-agent等等）
  >
  > JavaScript的一些行为，动态渲染，异步请求，使得爬虫获取的资源不正确
  >
  > CSS渲染，将一些资源序列进行变更，这样也可能使得浏览器可视资源与爬虫获取资源不同

- 网络API

  > 网络API不同于爬虫，网络API是为了开发者更好地使用，因此往往有文档以及接口
  >
  > 我常查看文档来编写，比如之前的ChatGPT qq聊天机器人

- Linux系统

  > Linux软硬链接区别：软链接只会指向源文件，硬链接是一个实体文件，但是和源文件是同一个文件，类似于C++中的共享指针一样。`ln -s link src`(软)  `ln link src`(硬)
  >
  > 权限：文件的权限分为读写执行三个权限，一般的脚本文件都需要设置可执行权限
  >
  > 用户权限：`chmod`
  >
  > 更改文件所有者：`chown`

# 英文自我介绍

&emsp;Hello, professors, my name is Liang Minzhi. I majored in electronic science and technology at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I am very happy to participate in this interview.

&emsp;During my undergraduate, I worked hard at school and achieved excellent results. My GPA is 3.7, ranking 31 out of 223 in our major. The grade point of many courses such as advanced mathematics, C language, Java, data structure and algorithm is around 4.5.

&emsp;I have actively participated in competitions and won many awards, such as the First Prize in the computer contest, the M Prize in the Mathematical Contest In Modeling and so on. But what impresses me the most is a UAV project. I learned a lot from it during the one-year preparation. I am skilled in C or C++ for MCU and Linux systems. I deploy my blog on a cloud serve. Additionally, I am good at Python and web API calls. I often used Matlab to verify our models in mathematical modeling.

&emsp;In addition to studying, I serve as a lecturer and vice-chairman of the computer department in Association for Science and Technology. I teach computer skills to new members, manage the lab, and represent the club at meetings led by teachers.

&emsp;In the first year of postgraduate, I will continue to study hard and expand my knowledge about cyber security, I will determine the research direction and follow the frontier trends. In the second year, I will start to prepare my graduation thesis, find an innovative point and conduct in-depth research. Finally, I will make excellent results and complete my graduation thesis. If possible, I would choose to study for a Ph.D.

&emsp;Thank you for listening!
